                    <p>Drummer and singer <strong>Isolde Lasoen</strong> is no longer known only as 'drummer of
                        <strong>DAAN</strong>'. Over the years she has proven to be a versatile musician who commits
                        herself to various bands and projects with great passion and dedication.

                        and writing music. She started her very own band in 2012, released her first EP
                        <strong>L'Inconnu</strong> in 2014 (Coucou Records), and a few years later she composed and
